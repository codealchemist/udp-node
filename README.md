# udp-node

Find and communicate with network nodes over UDP.

## Install

`npm install --save udp-node`

## Sample

In the `sample` folder you'll find the basics of finding nodes and sending custom messages.
The code is prepared to run on the same machine by changing default port on one node.

## Find all nodes

In this example we will send a *broadcast* message to find all nodes in the network.
These nodes are other instances of **udp-node**.

```
const UdpNode = require('udp-node')
const six = new UdpNode()
six
  .set({
    name: 'Six',
    type: 'machine'
  })
  .broadcast()
  .onNode((message, rinfo) => {
    // FOUND NODE
    // message: contains node's name, type and other details set when node was initialized using set()
    // rinfo: contains node's ip address and port
  })
```

This broadcast message is sent to the default port, 3024.
Nodes listening on that port will automatically answer with a *pong* message.

## Find specific nodes

When a node is created it can set a _type_.
Then, you can send a *broadcast* message filtering by _type_.
Nodes belonging to that _type_ are the only ones who will answer with a *pong*.

```
const UdpNode = require('udp-node')
const six = new UdpNode()
six
  .set({
    name: 'Six',
    type: 'machine'
  })
  .broadcast({
    filter: ['human']
  })
  .onNode((message, rinfo) => {
    // FOUND HUMAN NODE
  })
```



## Methods

### set(params)

Initializes **udp-node**.
Must be called to start udp client.

Params object:
- name: string, node's name
- type: string, node's type; used on broadcast filter
- port: int, default is 3024
- broadcastAddress: string, default is 255.255.255.255
- logLevel: calls setLogLevel with passed value

### broadcast(params)

Sends a broadcast message to the network.
Other *udp-nodes* will respond with a *pong* message containing their identity.

Params object:
- filter: array, used to get a pong from specific node types
- port: int, default is 3024
- address: string, default is 255.255.255.255
- data: object, custom data to be included in broadcast message

### ping(params)

Sends a *ping* message to a specific **udp-node**.
If that node is available it will respond with a *pong* message containing its identity.

Params object:
- address: string, required; the address of the node we want to ping; example: 192.168.1.123
- port: int, default is 3024
- data: object, custom data to be included in ping message

### send(message, callback)

Sends a custom message.

`message` properties:
- type: string, required; this is the message type, not to be confused with node's type
- port: int, default is 3024
- address: string, default is 255.255.255.255

After the message is sent passed callback is called.

### on(type, callback)

Adds a listener for a custom message.
When a message of the specified type is recieved calls the passed callback.

Returns the index of the added listener, which can be used with the off method to turn it off.

Params:
- type: string, required; any string that identifies the message type
- callback: function, required; called each time a message of specified type is received

### off(type, index)

Turns off individual listeners or all listeners for passed message type when index is not provided.

Params:
- type: string, required; any string that identifies the message type
- index: int, identifies a specific listener

### setLogLevel(level)

**udp-node** uses [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for logging.
Please, refer to [logging levels](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging-levels) on the official documentation for more details.

Params:
- level: string, required; one of: error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly

### close(callback)

Closes UDP socket.
Should always be called after finished working with the **udp-node** to ensure the socket is closed and the port freed up.
When the socket is closed calls passed callback.

## Notes

If you want to run multiple nodes on the same machine you'll need to provide different ports to each one.
You can easily do this by passing the `port` property when calling `set()` on each node.
